Each year, School of Government faculty and professional staff members produce summaries of legislation of interest to local and state government officials. These summaries appear in a variety of formats; for your convenience, these summaries have all been collected and can be found below according to subject matter. A number of bills affect several subject matters and may be found in more than one document. To further investigate bills referred to in these summaries, explore the North Carolina General Assembly Web site(link is external). To access summaries of legislation published from 1955-2008, please visit North Carolina Legislation.
