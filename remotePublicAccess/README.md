ONLINE FEE SCHEDULEFollowing is the fee schedule for online access to both criminal and civil information in all 100 North Carolina counties:

    $495.00 - One-time connection fee (non-refundable); includes two user IDs and two admin IDs.
    $70.00 - One-time fee for each additional user ID needed.
    $0.21 - The access fee per transaction. Access fees are billed on a monthly basis based on usage. Each new task, indicated by the pressing of the "Enter" key, the "PA1," "PA2," or "PA3" keys, the function keys "F1" through "F12," or the "Clear" key, is considered a transaction. Most times when a transaction occurs, a new screen appears, but that is not always the case.

Payment for the initial connection fee and any additional user IDs must be in the form of a cashier's check, made out to "N.C. Administrative Office of the Courts."
